		<h2>Challenge:</h2>
		<p>Please create a function that takes in a number. Print all the numbers from 1 to that number in the console, but skip any number that when multiplied by three is divisible by 2.</p>

		<h2>Notes:</h2>
		<p>This one ruffled my little brain with math, but after feeling good about the function I built, give it a try yourself! As usual, open up your console in the browser and call the function with "wickedMath(number)" and replace the number within the parentheses with a number of your pick.</p>
