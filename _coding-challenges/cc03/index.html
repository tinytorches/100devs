		<h2>Challenge:</h2>
		<p>Please create a function that takes in an array. The function should console.log() the sum of the first value in the array and the last value in the array</p>

		<h2>Notes:</h2>
		<p>So I've got it to work with an array that's already declared. The "mathArray" I've written is "let mathArray = [101, 749, 125, 200]". Checking the console you should see the value 301. The next steps would probably be to better optimize the code and to also prompt the user what kind of integer elements they'd like to place within the "mathArray" so that the "sumOfFirstAndLastValue" function would have a more useful... function.</p>

		<i>If you can't see the value 301 in the console, try calling it with "console.log(sumOfFirstAndLastValue(mathArray))"</i>
