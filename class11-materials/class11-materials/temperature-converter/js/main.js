//Write your pseduo code first! 

// I need a temperature (value)
// I need to convert that value with maths
// I need to display the converted value on-screen

// pass 2: be more realistic with JS-lingo
// get value out of the input
// take that value and put it into a variable
// do some quick mafs and store that new variable in its own variable
// Present that new converted variable on-screen
